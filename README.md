## Projects
### Workout prediction using motion sensor data
Developed a Python-based machine learning project to accurately predict workout types—such as barbell lifts, squats, deadlifts, overhead presses, and rows—from motion sensor data. The project features a comprehensive pipeline encompassing data preprocessing, visualization, outlier detection, feature engineering, predictive modelling, and a custom algorithm for precise repetition counting during exercises.
